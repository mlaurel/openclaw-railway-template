# Tools for skills

Several bundled OpenClaw skills drive command-line tools. The image includes the
ones that make sense on a server as a pinned, checksum-verified **baseline**, so
a fresh deploy works immediately. Every one of them can then be updated on the
volume, where updates persist ([below](#keeping-tools-current)):

| Tool | Version | Used by | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gh` | 2.102.0 | GitHub connections, `github`, `gh-issues` | GitHub release, `Dockerfile` |
| `gog` | 0.43.0 | `gog` (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Sheets, Docs) | GitHub release, `Dockerfile` |
| `claude` | 2.1.285 | `coding-agent` | npm, `tools/package-lock.json` |
| `codex` | follows OpenClaw (0.158.0 in 2026.9.8) | `coding-agent` | already in the OpenClaw image |
| `jq`, `tmux` | Debian stable | `trello`, `tmux` | apt, `Dockerfile` |
| ImageMagick, libheif | Debian stable | OpenClaw's image processing: HEIC/HEIF photos (iPhone) | apt, `Dockerfile` |

`ffmpeg` is not included (it adds ≈370 MB). OpenClaw needs it only to convert
voice notes for WhatsApp and Feishu and for Discord voice channels; Telegram
doesn't need it. If you use those, `brew install ffmpeg` (untested here).

Skills for macOS (Apple Notes, Reminders, Bear, Things, Peekaboo) run on your
Mac through the paired app, not here. Skills for devices on your home network
(Sonos, Hue, cameras, Eight Sleep, local Spotify) can't reach it from Railway.

## Logins persist

`HOME` is `/data/home`, on the volume, so anything a tool stores under `~`
(Google tokens, Claude Code and Codex sessions, tool settings) survives
redeploys. Back it up with the rest of the volume.

`railway ssh` gives you a root shell. Run tool commands with `as-node` so their
files belong to the Gateway's user; the agent can't read root-owned files. (The
container hands stray root-owned files back to `node` on every start, but only
then.)

```bash
railway ssh --service openclaw -- as-node gog auth list
```

For an interactive login, open a shell first, then use `as-node` inside it:

```bash
railway ssh --service openclaw
as-node claude auth login
```

## Google (`gog`)

`gog` needs your own Google OAuth client and a password for its token file.
`gog-login` signs it in through your tailnet: Google redirects your browser to
`https://openclaw.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443/oauth2/callback`, and a Tailscale Serve
route that exists only while `gog-login` runs hands the callback to `gog`.
Nothing needs a `127.0.0.1` redirect or a pasted URL.

1. In Google Cloud Console, enable the APIs you want (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, …)
   and create an OAuth client of type **Web application** (a **Desktop app**
   client only allows `127.0.0.1` redirects). Under **Authorized redirect URIs**
   add `https://openclaw.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443/oauth2/callback`, using the
   machine's real name, and download the client JSON.
2. Give the token file a password, stored as a sealed Railway variable:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n' | railway variable set GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD --stdin --service openclaw
   ```

   (`GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` is already declared in `.railway/railway.ts`.)
3. Copy the client JSON onto the volume. The service has no domain, so use its
   instance ID (dashboard → ⌘K → **Copy Service Instance ID**):

   ```bash
   scp client_secret.json <service-instance-id>@ssh.railway.com:/data/home/gog-client.json
   ```

4. Store the client, then sign in from a shell (it waits for the browser):

   ```bash
   railway ssh --service openclaw
   as-node gog auth keyring file
   as-node gog auth credentials /data/home/gog-client.json && rm /data/home/gog-client.json
   gog-login you@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts,docs,sheets
   ```

   Open the printed URL on a device on your tailnet and approve. `gog-login`
   prints the redirect URI it uses; it must match the one registered in step 1.
   Check with `as-node gog auth list --check`. If it reports
   `no refresh token received`, the account had already granted these scopes to
   the project: rerun with `--force-consent`. To add the Web client next to an
   existing one, store it with `gog auth credentials --client web <file>` and
   pass `--client web` to `gog-login`.

**Verified** (2026-10-08): with a Web client in Google Cloud, Google accepts the
`.ts.net:8443` redirect URI and shows its account chooser; on a test node, a
callback sent over the tailnet reached `gog`, which rejected a forged `state`,
and the route was gone once `gog-login` exited (the live test tier repeats
this). Completing consent and the token exchange is the standard `gog` flow and
was not repeated in tests. The browser must be on the tailnet and allowed to
reach the machine on port 8443.

Never paste the client secret or tokens into a chat with the agent.

## Coding agents (`claude`, `codex`)

`claude` uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the service's variables when it's set,
so the `coding-agent` skill works with the key you onboarded with. To use a
Claude subscription instead, run `as-node claude auth login` in a `railway ssh`
shell. `codex` uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` when set, or `as-node codex login`.
The image's copy is the pinned baseline; `as-node claude install stable` adds a
self-updating copy on the volume ([below](#keeping-tools-current)).

## Keeping tools current

Tools resolve in this order (first match wins):

1. `/usr/local/sbin`: the `openclaw` and `brew` wrappers. The OpenClaw CLI always
   matches the running Gateway; it can't be shadowed or self-updated.
2. `~/.local/bin` on the volume: Claude Code's native install, `npm install -g`.
3. Homebrew on the volume (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` → `/data/linuxbrew`).
4. The image's baseline.

So an update you install on the volume takes over from the image's copy and
survives redeploys:

| Tool | Update it with | Then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `as-node claude install stable` (or `latest`) | updates itself |
| Codex | `as-node npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` | rerun to update, or follow Codex's own prompt |
| `gh`, `gog`, `jq`, `tmux` | `brew install gh gogcli jq tmux` | `brew upgrade` |
| anything else | `brew install <formula>`, `as-node npm install -g <package>` | `brew upgrade`, `npm update -g` |

Run these through `railway ssh --service openclaw -- …`; `brew` already runs as
`node` without `as-node`. Homebrew pours prebuilt bottles (verified for
`gogcli`). Some formulae also pull Homebrew's own glibc and libraries, a few
hundred MB on the volume the first time. Homebrew updates its formula list
when you install; `HOMEBREW_CACHE` is in `/tmp`, so downloads don't fill the
volume.

**What this layer gives up.** Tools on the volume aren't pinned: they change when
you or the agent update them, not through a reviewed PR, and rolling back the
image doesn't roll them back. To return to the baseline, remove the override:
`as-node rm ~/.local/bin/claude`, `brew uninstall <formula>`, or
`as-node npm uninstall -g <package>`. The agent can use the same commands, so
it can install software too ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#tools-in-the-image)).

## Changing the image's baseline

- **Pinned release binaries** (`gh`, `gog`): change the version and both
  checksums (amd64, arm64) in the `Dockerfile` `RUN` step, copying the checksums
  from the release's checksum file. The build fails on a mismatch.
- **npm tools**: add them to `tools/package.json` and run
  `npm install --package-lock-only` in `tools/`. Dependabot proposes updates.
  A package whose install script must run also needs an `allowScripts` entry
  (npm 12 blocks dependency scripts by default).
- **Debian packages**: add them to the `apt-get install` line.

Add a `--version` check for the new tool to `tests/image.test.sh`.

Each tool the agent can run widens what a prompt-injected agent could do with
it; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#tools-in-the-image).
