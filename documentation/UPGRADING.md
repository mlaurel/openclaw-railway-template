# Upgrading and rolling back

An OpenClaw upgrade is one change: the `FROM` line in `Dockerfile` (tag and
digest). The Gateway never updates itself in place: `OPENCLAW_SUPERVISOR_MODE=external`
makes OpenClaw refuse self-update, and `OPENCLAW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` disables
automatic update checks and applies.

**Merging to `main` deploys.** Railway builds and deploys every push to the
branch it watches. Treat the merge of an upgrade PR as the deploy step below.

## 1. Review the release

- Release notes: <https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases>. The npm
  package carries the same `CHANGELOG.md` and the docs for that exact version:
  `npm pack openclaw@<version> && tar xzf openclaw-<version>.tgz package/CHANGELOG.md package/docs`.
- Look for config migrations, retired keys, database schema changes, Node
  version changes, and anything under "Upgrading very old versions".
- Pick stable releases (`latest`). Avoid `-beta` tags. OpenClaw also publishes
  an `extended-stable` line if you prefer a slower cadence.

## 2. Update the pin

Dependabot opens a PR for new image tags weekly (`.github/dependabot.yml`), and
updates tag and digest together. To do it by hand:

```bash
version=2026.9.9   # example
docker buildx imagetools inspect "ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:$version" --format '{{json .Manifest}}' | jq -r .digest
# edit Dockerfile: FROM ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:<version>@sha256:<digest>
```

Nothing else references the OpenClaw version. (The Tailscale binaries have
their own `FROM … AS tailscale` line; see [Tailscale upgrades](#tailscale-upgrades).)

## 3–4. Build and validate

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds the image and runs `tests/image.test.sh`
against it on every PR. Among other things, it checks that `openclaw --version`
inside the built image equals the `FROM` tag, that a fresh volume boots, that an
existing volume survives a restart, and that auth, proxy attribution, the health
relay, and the security audit still behave. With the optional
`TAILSCALE_TEST_AUTHKEY` repository secret (a reusable, ephemeral auth key), it
also logs a node in to your tailnet and checks Tailscale Serve end to end;
Dependabot pull requests don't receive secrets, so they run the core tier only.
Don't merge on red.

To test an upgrade against a copy of real state, restore an OpenClaw backup
archive (step 5) into a local Docker volume and start the new image on it.

## 5. Back up

Two complementary backups; take both before merging an upgrade.

**Railway volume backup** (restorable in place, whole volume): in the dashboard,
`openclaw` service → **Backups** → **Create backup**. Manual backups are limited
to 50% of the volume size; grow the volume first if needed.

**OpenClaw archive** (portable, verified, off-platform):

```bash
railway ssh --service openclaw -- sh -c 'install -d -o node /tmp/openclaw-backup && openclaw backup create --verify --output /tmp/openclaw-backup && ls /tmp/openclaw-backup'
scp <service-instance-id>@ssh.railway.com:/tmp/openclaw-backup/<archive>.tar.gz .
```

(The service instance ID is in the dashboard: ⌘K → **Copy Service Instance
ID**.) `/tmp` is wiped on redeploy, so copy the archive off first. Always pass
`--output`: the default is the current directory, `/app`, which the `node` user
can't write. Archives contain credentials; store them like secrets. Verified
locally while the Gateway was running; SQLite files belonging to the bundled
Codex runtime are archived as raw bytes with a warning.

## 6. Deploy

Merge the PR. On start, OpenClaw's entrypoint runs `openclaw doctor --fix`
under exclusive state ownership before the Gateway starts, which applies config
and database migrations. Before changing a database schema, Doctor saves
`<database>.pre-startup-migration-<id>.bak` copies beside the originals. The
health check allows 600 seconds for this.

If Doctor can't migrate safely, the container exits with code **78** and Railway
keeps restarting it. Don't delete state or lock files; see
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#exit-code-78).

## 7–9. Verify

```bash
railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw --version     # the new version
railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw health
railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw status        # channels, agents
railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw security audit --deep
```

- **Desktop:** Mac app → Connection → **Test**. If the dashboard reports a
  protocol mismatch, hard-refresh or clear its site data.
- **Tailscale:** the deploy log shows `[tailscale] serve enabled: https://…/`
  again, with no new `logged in to Tailscale` line.
- **Channels:** send a Telegram DM; check `openclaw status` shows Telegram OK.

## Rolling back

**Rolling back the image does not roll back state.** Doctor migrates schemas
forward, and older releases refuse newer database schemas. A rollback is
therefore "old image + the backup taken before the upgrade":

1. Revert the upgrade commit and push. The old image starts and will likely
   refuse the migrated state (exit 78). That's expected, and safer than
   proceeding.
2. **Backups** → choose the pre-upgrade backup → **Restore**. Railway mounts a
   new volume from the backup and keeps the current one unmounted for
   inspection.
3. Review the staged change and **Deploy**. The old image now starts on the old
   state.

Anything written after the backup (conversations, pairings, config changes) is
lost in a rollback; the unmounted volume still has it if you need to recover
something by hand. **(live-unverified: the restore flow follows Railway's backup
docs.)**

Tools you installed or updated on the volume (`~/.local`, Homebrew in
`/data/linuxbrew`) and Tailscale's node state (`/data/tailscale`) are part of
that volume state: an image rollback leaves them
as they are, and a volume restore returns them to the backup's versions.

Railway's **Rollback** button (redeploy a previous image) is only safe for
releases that did not migrate state; read the release notes first.

## Tool upgrades

The image's skill tools are a baseline; you can also update them on the volume
without a deploy ([TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md#keeping-tools-current)). To move the
baseline itself:

- **`gh`, `gog`**: downloaded in `Dockerfile` `RUN` steps, which Dependabot
  doesn't track. Change the version and both checksums, copied from the
  release's checksums file (for `gh`:
  `gh release download v<version> -R cli/cli -p 'gh_*_checksums.txt'`). The
  build fails if a checksum doesn't match.
- **Claude Code**: Dependabot proposes updates to `tools/package-lock.json`;
  merging one redeploys.
- **Codex**: follows OpenClaw's own pin, so it moves with OpenClaw upgrades.
- **Debian packages** (`jq`, `tmux`, ImageMagick): not pinned; every rebuild
  installs Debian's current security updates. Redeploy periodically to pick
  them up.
- **Homebrew**: the `Dockerfile` pins the seed copied onto a new volume. An
  existing volume's Homebrew updates itself and ignores the seed.

`tests/image.test.sh` checks that each tool runs.

## Tailscale upgrades

Dependabot proposes new `tailscale/tailscale` tags for the `FROM … AS tailscale`
line in `Dockerfile` (tag and digest together). The image copies only the
`tailscale` and `tailscaled` binaries from it, and CI checks that
`tailscale version` matches the tag. Node state on the volume carries across
versions; roll back by reverting the commit.

## Migrating from the two-service layout

Deployments created before Tailscale moved into the `openclaw` container had a
separate `tailscale` service and volume, raw TCP forwarding, and
`OPENCLAW_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`. The new image refuses to start on such a volume, with
a message naming these steps. **(live-unverified:** the steps below were checked
locally against an old-layout volume; the live migration has not been run yet.)

1. **Migrate the config** while the old deployment is still running, from a
   shell on its volume. Order matters: OpenClaw rejects `tailscale.mode serve`
   while `bind` is `lan`.

   ```bash
   railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw config set gateway.bind loopback
   railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw config set gateway.tailscale.mode serve
   railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw config unset gateway.publicOrigin
   railway ssh --service openclaw -- openclaw config unset plugins.entries.device-pair
   ```

   OpenClaw applies them at the next start (it prints "Restart the gateway to
   apply"), which should be the new image's. Do steps 1–4 in one sitting: if
   the old container restarts in between, it fails to start, because the old
   image has no Tailscale daemon for `serve` mode. Deploying the new image
   fixes that.
2. **Free the machine name.** In the Tailscale admin console, remove the old
   `openclaw` machine (the `tailscale` service's node). Otherwise the new
   container registers as `openclaw-1` and clients configured for
   `openclaw.<tailnet>.ts.net` stop connecting. This takes the old path offline.
3. **Set the auth key** on the `openclaw` service (a new key, not the one the
   `tailscale` service used):

   ```bash
   pbpaste | tr -d '\n' | railway variable set TS_AUTHKEY --stdin --service openclaw --skip-deploys
   ```

4. **Deploy** the new image (merge, or `railway redeploy --service openclaw --yes`
   if `main` already has it). Expect `logged in to Tailscale as openclaw` and
   `[tailscale] serve enabled: https://openclaw.<tailnet>.ts.net/`.
5. **Remove the old service.** With the new `.railway/railway.ts`,
   `railway config plan` shows the `tailscale` service and `tailscale-state`
   volume as deletions. Read the plan, then `railway config apply`. Delete
   `OPENCLAW_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` from the `openclaw` service too (the plan lists it).
6. **Tidy up.** Tag the new machine or disable its key expiry. The Mac app keeps
   its URL and token; device pairings live on the `openclaw` volume and carry
   over.

## Migrating from the previous deployment

Moving data from the old `arjunkomath/openclaw-railway-template` deployment is a
separate, approved operation and not covered here. Don't point this template at
the old volume.
